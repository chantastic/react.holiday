<div class="measure">
This is an React advent thingy; the whole 25 days, 25 lessons deal.

### Why?

I don't know.

I think most React education is pathelogically complicated and I like the
holidays.

This is a modified version of how I teach people React. It covers patterns,
practices, and tools I use every day IRL.

None of the üê¥üí© you see pegging Hacker News.

### Prerequisit?

I expect you to know JavaScript pretty well.

I don't cover setting up a build or working with Node.

Examples use [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/) transport well to a
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
environment.

### Who dis?

I'm [@chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic) and I make other React stuff
like [learnreact.com](https://learnreact.com) ,
[https://reactpatterns.com](https://reactpatterns.com) , and
[https://reactcheatsheet.com](https://reactpatterns.com).
