Today, I offer a simple recommendation:

> Prefer named function declarations for component descriptions

As developers, we edit, debug, extend, and refactor existing code WAY more often than we create new code. So I prefer "code style" that keeps change to a minimum.

## Why named function declarations are great for components

There are four things that make named [function declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function) a perfect fit for describing components.

**Debugging**. [Named functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/name) tell React how to tailor error messaging in the console and [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi).

**Adding Hooks**.Â Function declarations have a required [function block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block) and return. This block and return are required for any component using React Hooks. So, while [arrow function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) may "look cleaner" (without Hooks), they require more code motion to utilize Hooks.

**Hoisting**. Function declarations are automatically [hoisted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting). Function declarations are available anywhere, indifferent to where the function resides in a file (top, bottom, middle).

**Diffs**. When changing a component from implicit returns to explicit return (to use Hooks), the indentation is effected. In a git diff, it now it looks like the whole component changed. Defaulting to a syntax with an explicit return keeps diffs clear and legible.

## Take it home

Check out [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/lively-wind-00qws?file=/src/App.js). It illustrations all the common ways you can create a component.

What's your preference?

What good or bad experiences reinforced that preferences? Do you agree or disagree with my reasons? Do you have any exceptions I should should be considering?
