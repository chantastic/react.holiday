Here is some lifecycle wisdom:

> Always use `Did` methods, unless you shouldn't.

Confused? Read on for more (confusion).

## Why `Did`?

`Did` methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` are "safe".  
They fire after React finishes its work.
So your futzing won't collide with React's futzing.

**Use `Did` methods are first choice.**

## Why not `Did`?

Sometimes `Did`s don't do exactly what you need.

In our `Pokemon` component, using `componentDidUpdate` will fetch and `setState` with a new Pokemon with each update.
That sounds like what we want but isn't.

New props update `Pokemon` but so does the `setState` calls.
Infinite loops, run!!!

We have one of those **"unless you shouldn't"** cases.

## Enter `componentWillReceiveProps`

We need a hero lifecycle method that fires for new props but not new state.
`componentWillReceiveProps` is that hero.

```jsx
componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
  fetchPokemon(nextProps.id).then(character =>
    this.setState({ character: character })
  )
}
```
<br />

This lifecycle method fires **before** `this.props` is set to the new props.
So we don't use `this.props`.
We use the `nextProps`, which `componentWillReceiveProps` receives as an argument.

You're just gonna have to play with this one...

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and explore `componentWillReceiveProps`.
* Compare `this.props` and `nextProps` by logging them.
  * Change the local name of `nextProps`. There's nothing special about the name.
* Read [the docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentwillreceiveprops). Any other things `componentWillReceiveProps` can do?
