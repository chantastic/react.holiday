People like to make hay about [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/).

Don't get your undies in a bunched over it. All it does is make these two lines
equivalent:

```jsx
// No-JSX
React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello ðŸŽ„")

// YAAAAS!!!-JSX
<h1>Hello ðŸŽ„</h1>
```

### How does HTML in JavaScript work?

Don't think of it like HTML and you'll be happier; it isn't.

JSX must be transformed to the `React.createElement()` calls before the browser
can run it. Apps use libraries like [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) or
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) to handle the code transformation.

### Why JSX?

JSX is optional but it has community consensus. There's a certain parity in
describe React elements in a syntax similar to HTML.

### Gotchas

JSX isn't all ðŸ¦„s and ðŸŒˆs.

Lowercase attributes like `class`, `onclick`, `autofocus`, and `tabindex` become
camelCased `className`, `onClick`, `autoFocus`, and `tabIndex` respectively and
can take any JS expression.

#### HTML

```html
<button
  type="button"
  autofocus
  class="some-button"
  onclick="alert('HTML!')"
>Hello ðŸŽ„</button>
```

#### JSX

```jsx
<button
  type="button"
  autoFocus
  className="some-button"
  onclick={() => alert('JSX!')}
>Hello ðŸŽ„</button>
```

#### JS

```js
React.createElement(
  'button',
  {
    type: 'button',
    autoFocus: true,
    className: 'some-button',
    onclick: () => alert('JS!'),
  },
  'Hello ðŸŽ„'
)
```

## Tinker with it

Use the window below and play around with the JSX.

* Try using `class` instead of `className`. What error do you get?
* Nest a couple elements inside of each other. Did they render as expected? How
  would you write the same using `React.createElement()`?
