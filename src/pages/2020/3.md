Every array method is unique.

Some modify an array and return the resulting length. Some run a function for every value and return undefined. Others don't modify anything and return a completely new array.

With [34 methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), there's a lot to memorize (or search for on StackOverflow).

Fortunately, these methods divide pretty cleanly into two categories: mutating and non-mutating.

## Mutating vs Non-Mutating

Mutate is a funny word. Let's use "modify" instead.

Two methods that let you "add values" to an array are `push()` and `concat()` but they do it in different ways.

items.push("chan") modifies the array assigned to items¬†‚Äî it's a mutating method.

`items.concat(["chan"])` does not modify the array assigned to items ‚Äî it's a non-mutating method. Instead it returns the result as a new array.

## React Favors Immutability

React favors functions and methods that don't modify arrays and objects but ‚Äî istead ‚Äî return new ones.

So, you'll see a methods like slice, join, map, filter, reduce, and concat used a lot. And you won't see much forEach, push, unshift, and splice.

Do these methods modify data (mutating) or do they operate on their array instances without modifying the data (non-mutating)?
