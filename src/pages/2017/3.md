<div class="measure">

Components are just functions.

<span style="font-size: 3em">ðŸ¤¯</span>

### How do I write said component functions?

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello ðŸŽ„</h1>;
}
```

### How do I use said component functions?

```jsx
<Greeting />
```

### That's it?

Pretty much.

Just remember to capitalize your custom components.
If you don't, JSX will assume that you meant a native DOM element.

## Tinker with it

Use the window below play with custom components.

* Write and use a component of your own creation.
* Try mixing custom components and native components.
