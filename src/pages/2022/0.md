Hey friends!

Welcome the _6th annual React Holiday_ ⚛️🎄

This year is all about **Next.js 13** (experimental). I chose Next.js because it's the **first framework with a fully React architecture**. It's the first time we've been able to play with **React 18 concurrent features** for data-fetching, suspense, and server components. And it showcases React's vision for future web applications.

You're in for a real treat!

See you tomorrow for day 1⃣
