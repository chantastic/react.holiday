In our first email, I asked what you thought the most privileged type in React was. I said “array” — because I’m a big dork. Most everyone else said “function!”

I think we're all right.

React itself has a special relationship with arrays. But — because it’s a JavaScript framework — it share’s JavaScript’s affinity for functions.

## What’s an expression?

I’ve used the term “function expression” in previous emails to describe function syntax. But what is an expression?

In human terms, an expression is a way to ask and answer a question:

Question: `greet(woodyVoice, "chantastic")`?  
Answer: `"Howdy, howdy howdy, chantastic!"`

And it doesn’t have to be complex. An expression is anything that gets evaluated: `console.log("Hello" + " " + "world!")`

Expressions are how arrays become lists, arrow functions become event handlers, and function declarations become React elements.

Seeing how these expressions can be ~~exploited~~ used in React is quite fun.

## Take it home

Modern JavaScript and JSX can make expressions hard to spot. [Open this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/wonderful-keller-mp0z1?file=/src/index.js) and count all the expressions you see.

[Join us in Discord](https://chan.dev/discord) with your answer. I think this will spark a lively discussion.
