<div class="measure">
Back in the `C` days, pragrams had a `main()` function. This is where they
started.

React web projects are similar; They start with `ReactDOM.render()`.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(someReactComponent, someDOMNode)
```

### WTF is ReactDOM?

React gets used on a bunch of platformsâ€”web, mobile, desktop, VR. Instead of
stuffing all of those smarts into one library, the platform specific bits are
split into plactform specific labraries.

When using React on the web, you use `React` to create components and `ReactDOM`
mount them into the DOM.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createEelement('h1', {}, 'Hello ðŸŽ„'),
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```
