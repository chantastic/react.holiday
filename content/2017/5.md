<div class="measure">

Some components have to be special.
Those components get defined with **class**.

```jsx
class ClapCounter extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        üëè <i> be the first to clap</i>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

It's not much to look at now.
We'll fill it in this week.

## Some ground rules

Component classes extend `React.Component` and define a `render()` method.

For comparison, here's what `Greeting` looks like as a component class.

```jsx
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello {this.props.name}.</h1>
    );
  }
}
```


## What speshul powerz they got?!

Unlike function components, class components have an instance‚Äî`this`. This gives us [lifecycle methods and state APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) for some seriously cool interactivity.

Sooooooo much ahead!

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and play with component classes.

* Convert `Greeting` to a component class and back to a function.
* Define a new component using class. Be sure not to forget `extends`, `render()` and `this`.
