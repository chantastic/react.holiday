There’s a simple heuristic that JSX uses to determine what you’re trying to render.

Lowercase `<div />` becomes `React.createElement("div")`. A string is used to create a host element (react-dom) by that name.

Uppercase `<MyDiv />` becomes `React.createElement(MyDiv)`. A function reference is used to create an element from a named component definition.

Object property `<Module.Component />` becomes `React.createElement(Module.Component)`. A function reference is used to create an element from a component definition, nested inside an object. (It also works with lowercase `props.componentName`. Give it a try!)

But you can do more without JSX than you can with it.

For examples, there’s no JSX equivalent for a conditional: `React.createElement(someCondition ? FancyDiv : "div")`
