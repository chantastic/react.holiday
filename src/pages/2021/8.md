Yesterday we learned a simple way to replace React 17‚Äôs render callback. Today I want to cover another recommendation that is more invasive.

This approach is neat because it provides your callback with a reference to the rendered element ‚Äî something not possible with the legacy root API.

But it involves modifying our component to take a callback prop and apply it as a ref.

```jsx
function App({ callback }) {
return <div ref={callback}>‚Ä¶</div>
}
ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(
<App callback={(ref) => console.log(‚Äúrenderered‚Äù, ref)} />
);
```

This approach requires that we change our components. This can be especially invasive if our application mounts multiple root-level components.

So, I‚Äôd avoid it unless you have a good use for the returned ref.

While not recommended by the React core team, I explored 3 additional render callback alternatives with the [Lunch Dev crew](https://discord.gg/lunchdev).
