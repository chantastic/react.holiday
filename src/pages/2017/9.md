<div class="measure">

If you want to set state dynamically, use a **function**.

```js
this.setState(function(previousState) {
  return { someProp: previousState.someProp + 1 }
})
```
<br />

We give `setState` an anonymous function to be called with `state`.
Our function takes that `state` and returns a new object with new values derived from the old.

## Concise but not clear

This is how I write `setState(fn)` in a modern code base.
It's how you're likely to see it in the real world.

```js
this.setState((previousState) =>
  ({ clapCount: previousState.clapCount + 1 })
)
```
<br />

[Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) have implicit returns
but if the return type is an object, you must wrap it in parentheses.

## Why `previousState` not `currentState`?

While `setState` does update state—**eventually**—it does so asynchronously and in batches.

Because of that implementation detail, the state that your function receives might not be the current state.

## I'm so confused...

Yeah.
It's very confusing.

Tomorrow let's implement our own state setter.
You'll get a better idea of how `setState` sausage is made.

_(I'll use an actual sausage to illustrate)_

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and set some state with functions.
* Experiment with syntax. Use both [function declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function) and [arrow function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) to dynamically set state. Does one seem clearer than the other?
* For fun, use [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to unpack values from the `state` object.
