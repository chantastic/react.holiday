Keep learning at lunch.dev 🧑‍🎓

Happy holidays, friends!

Congratulations on crushing another React Holiday. Your perseverance is most impressive.

There is SO much we couldn’t cover in these 25 days — like ES Modules, CSS, functional composition and more — but the fun isn’t over!

I’m continuing the fun on [lunch.dev](https://www.lunch.dev/member?coupon=2020HOLIDAY) (the new home for my video resources) in a series I’m titling Everything But the React.

[Join the fun by January 2nd](https://www.lunch.dev/member?coupon=2020HOLIDAY) and get a lifetime 40% discount on membership.

Have a great new year!  
Hit me up on twitter [@chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic) or in [Discord](https://chan.dev/discord)!

Your friend,
