One of the [special powers](/2017/5) of class components is their ability to hold state.

With state, you get interactivity.
No state, no interactivity.
So component state isn't just **a** feature, it's **the** feature.

## How I do dat state hawtnez?

Start with an initial state.
Do this in the constructor of your class components.

```jsx
class MyStateOfMind extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { sexy: true }
  }
  ...
```

In `create-react-app` projects, use this [ESNext syntax](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/) to avoid the constructor noise.

```jsx
class MyStateOfMind extends React.Component {
  state = { sexy: true }
  ...
```

## Back to Claps

Let's add a `clapCount` state to the `ClapsCounter` we worked on [yesterday](/2017/6).

```jsx
class ClapCounter extends React.Component {
  state = { clapCount: 0 }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() =>
            alert(this.state.clapCount + 1 + " claps")
          }
        >
          {this.state.clapCount}{' '}üëè
        </button>
        <i> be the first to clap</i>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Stay sexy, nerds

Now you know how to initialize state and your state of mind will always be sexy.

As for our `clapCount` state, it'll be changing tomorrow...

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and play with state.
* Change the initial state from `0` to `100`. Does the alert read `101 claps`?
* Add more state properties. Try strings, numbers, function expressions, whatever you want.
