## Hi 👋

First things first.  
You're awesome and I believe in you.  
You got this.

Starting tomorrow, we'll build a small Pokemon app with React — using a real API and future features like Hooks and Suspense.

It's gon' be 🔥

## What you need to know

The whole thing happens "in the cloud".  
No dev environment to setup.  
We'll use [CodeSandbox](http://codesandbox.io/).  
You need a free [Github](https://github.com/) account to use it.  
If you don't yet have one, make one.

## About the material

Each lesson will be 1-3 minute read, with a couple assignments.
If you signed up for emails, I'll email you.
If in here for less frequent updates.

Here's an example of what the first week looks like:

<div style="padding: 0 2em">

- _It's time to let old things die_ — Why function components are the future
- _Lists are 99.7% of the job_ — Using .map() to create lists
- _Minimum Viable Suspense_ — Fetching resources with Suspense
- _Forget what you know about "Smart" and "Dumb" components_ — What resources mean for HoCs and Render Props.
- _WTF is a Resource?_ — What Resources are in React next.

If those topics feel a little quick,  
Check out [last years gentle introduction to React](/2017/).

I'm on your side 👫👬👭
