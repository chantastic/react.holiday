You probably screaming at me for not abstracting our pokemon-fetching, state-setting, transtiion-starting, suspense-coordinating `onClick` handler into an easy to remember function name.

That's fair.

In a real app, we don't want the liability of stringing four calls together ever click.
But where do we draw the line?

I see one natural division:

1. Functions that _must_ be composed inside the component (the hooks)
1. Functions that can be composed anywhere

First, the hooks…
We can compose `startTrasition` and `setPokemonResource` into a single function. And because we've named the state updater `setPokemonResource`, we can use a more direct name like `setPokemon` for our composed event handler.

```js
let setPokemon = (resource) =>
  startTransition(() => setPokemonResource(resource));
```

We can compose our suspense-coordinated `fetch` request anywhere.
In a real-world app, this would likely happen in a module.

```js
let getPokemon = (id) => suspensify(fetchPokemon(id));
```

That leaves with a very flexible and terse event handler:

```js
() => setPokemon(getPokemon(id));
```

Now, you could boil it down to a single function, but this is plenty terse for me.

P.S.
Open up [today's StackBlitz demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-zfkvhc?file=src/App.js).
Add a "Previous" button. And maybe play with boiling these event handlers down even further.

What do we to make this pokemon-fetching, state-setting, transtion-starting, suspense-coordinating onClick handler easier to use?.
I think we can cut it into two:
Functions that must be composed inside the component (hooks)
Functions that can be composed anywhere
Let's start with the hooks…
We can compose startTrasition and setPokemonResource into a single function inside our component. Because we’ve named the state updater setPokemonResource, we can use a more direct name like setPokemon for our composed event handler.
let setPokemon = (resource) =>
  startTransition(() =>
    setPokemonResource(resource))
Next, the fetch…
We can compose our suspense-coordinated fetch request anywhere. In a real-world app, this would likely happen in a module.
let getPokemon = (id) => suspensify(fetchPokemon(id))
That leaves with a very flexible and terse event handler:
() => setPokemon(getPokemon(id))
For me, these two functions provide the right balance of clarity and flexibility!
