Before [render props](https://reactpatterns.com/#render-prop) where used to stitch stateful and non-stateful components together, they were used in React Native for [rendering lists](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist).

This pattern borrows from the iOS notion of delegation. And remember, “render prop” == “React-branded delegation”. Here’s what that looks like to in React Native:

```jsx
<FlatList data={someArray} renderItem={(item) => <Text>{item}</Text>} />
```

This component takes data as a prop and a iterator callback to map over it with. A simplified implementation looks like this:

```jsx
function FlatList({ data, renderItem }) {
  return <>{data.map(renderItem)}</>;
}
```

By giving the component consumer control of both the input and output, we've made this List component generic and reusable.

## Take it home

In [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/nostalgic-hooks-m5c03?file=/src/App.js) you’ll find a `PokemonList` component that fetches a list of Pokemon and exposes them via render prop. Extract the rendered list into a generic `List` component. Remember, that component should take both _data_ and the _iterator_ callback needed to transform it.
