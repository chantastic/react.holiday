Below is the first example on [reacts.org](https://reactjs.org/). It shows the interplay of functions, JavaScript, JSX, and HTML that makes React unique.

```jsx
let Greeting({ name }) { return <div>Hello {name}</div> }
```

It also demonstrates a big omission in the design of JSX.

JSX doesn’t have a syntax for rendering custom components with an alternate host element. Specially, this component will always render as a `div` — excluding it from [inline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements) use.

It’d be nice to tell React “render Greeting but as a span.”

There’s no first class JSX syntax for that. But React, JSX, and a bit of JS trickery make this possible in our own code. Use what we’ve learned about JS expressions to _inject_ the desired component by passing it in as a prop.

```jsx
<Greeting As="span" />
```

Of course custom components can be injected as well.

```jsx
<Greeting as={MyFancyDiv} />
```

Here’s what this pattern looks like as a component declaration:

```jsx
let Greeting({ As, name }) {
  return <As>Hello {name}</As>
}
```

## Take it Home

There’s something kinda funny about this `As` prop we’ve made. That funny thing is because of a JSX heuristic we learned about earlier. Can you put your finger on it? Can you change it to make it more natural? [Explore in this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/as-prop-step-1-j7ep3?file=/src/App.js).
