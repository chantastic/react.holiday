[Smart vs. Dumb components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
is a dichotomy that has dominated the React conversation as long as React has
existed.

Here's the nut: **Some components know things. Some don't.**

## Knowing components

[Yesterday's](/2017/19) Pokemon app only has **knowing** components. They know
the `id` and how to change that `id`. They know when, where, and how to `fetch`
new data.

They know things.

## Unknowing components

**Unknowing** components operate on `props` alone. If the component works
strictly with `props`, it's an **unknowing** component.

```jsx
const Unknowing = props => (
  <div>Hi {props.name}! I didn't know you until now.</div>
)
```

## Extracting unknowing components

[Yesterday's](/2017/19) `Pokemon` is all tangled. It knows how to fetch **and**
how to present.

We can untangle it by splitting `Pokemon` into two components.

`FetchPokemon` (**knowing**) keeps the smarts required to fetch a Pokemon then
gives what it knows to `Pokemon` (**unknowing**) through props.

```jsx
class FetchPokemon extends React.Component {
  state = { character: null }
  componentDidMount() { ... }
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) { ... }

  render() { return <Pokemon character={this.state.character} />) }
}
```

<br />

`Pokemon` (**unknowing**) has no smarts and only renders what it's given.

```jsx
const Pokemon = props =>
  <div>
    <h2>{props.character.name}</h2>
    ...
```

## Why though?

<pre style={{ fontSize: "2em" }}>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</pre>

This pattern alone is useless—strictly cosmetic.
But—when paired with [render&nbsp;props](/2017/19)—it's how you do [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) in React.

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and explore **knowing** and **unknowing** components.

* Reconstruct the coupled version of `Pokemon`.
* Separate `Pokemon` and `FetchPokemon` again. Practice makes perfect.
* See the [render prop](2017/19) opportunity? Take it.
