I'm won't lie. I've tried all month to find a email-size demo for `startTransition` that worked well on all machines.

Turns out it's really hard.

If you don't believe me, check out [these demos](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/65) in the React Working group discussions.

But my failure to find a small, manageable demo is informative.
Performance problems in a React app can be boiled down into two camps:

1. I/O (or network)
1. Compute (or hardware)

React transitions are designed solve both problems. But I/O (network) is much easier to make generally understandable demos for. As we explore, know that the same transition APIs that we'll use for data-fetching can be applied to compute-heavy functions.

For tomorrow, I've setup a [minimal Suspense for data-fetching example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ky1gmq?file=src%2FApp.js) StackBlitz. This will be the basis for all future lessons. Take it for a spin, explore the code and read the comments, and hit reply if you have any questions üòä
