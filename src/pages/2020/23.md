Take a second and think about a form you've built in React.

OK! Come back!  
I'm sure that was frightening. So let's move on quickly.

There's an input type that I think most React developers sleep on: `type="reset"`. It's a godsend for quickly reseting an entire form without writing a bespoke reset function.

Of course, React has a standing recommendation that form inputs be [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) vs [uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html). Controlled components ensure that React remains the source of truth — not the DOM. `type="reset"` is incompatable with that recommendation — making React respond to the truth in the DOM.
I'm not one to tell you what to think… but I do want you to know the alternatives are before implement a less reliable reset function yourself 😁

## Take it home

Open [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/form-reset-30bij?file=/src/App.js:769-770). Without any intervention on our part, the Reset button resets the entire form. Too good to be true? Add more inputs and see for yourself.

Looking for a challenge? Take it a step further and reset the form after Submit.
