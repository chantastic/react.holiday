<div class="measure">

Today, we start with a new component!

<span style="font-size: 2em">ðŸŽŠ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ ðŸŽ‰</span>

## Pokemon

Take a stab at writing this component
[in a new sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/new) before reading the next
section.

* Name the component `Pokemon`
* Make sure it's a component that can hold [`state`](/2017/7/)
* Use `{ character: null }` as the initial state
* Take an `id` [prop](/2017/4). It'll be the index of the Pokemon we fetch.
* Render [conditionally](/2017/11):
  * If `state` has a `character`, render `this.state.character.name`
  * Otherwise render the message `...loading`

_(At this point, it should always render `...loading`)_

## Fetch a Pokemon

You got it? Great!

In the workspace below, I've included a `fetchPokemon` function. We'll use it in
the next section.

## Meet `componentDidMount`

`componentDidMount` is a [special power](/2017/5) our component has. Speaking
technically, it's a method on our component class.

When defined, it's called when a `Pokemon` is _mounted_ into the DOM.

```jsx
componentDidMount() {
  fetchPokemon(1, (character) => this.setState({ character: character }))
}
```

<br />

`componentDidMount` **is the
[ideal place to fetch data from a server.](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount)**

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and explore fetching data in `componentDidMount`:

* Fetch a pokemon with a different id
* Log messages from `componentDidMount` and `render` observe the order in the
  console.
