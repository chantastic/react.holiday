Let's get back to React before I get carried away by arrays…

This line of React blew my mind:

```jsx
<ul>{items.map(item => <li>{item}</li>}</ul>
```

In every framework I'd used, before React, I'd used iteration to produce lists — `each`, `forEach`, `repeat`, etc.

But React components understand arrays!

```jsx
<div>{[1, "2", (three = 3), true && "4"]}</div>
```

And those arrays can hold more React Elements:

```jsx
<ul>{[<li>1</li>, <li>2</li>, <li>3</li>]}</ul>
```

Of course using arrays for static content — like this —feels silly. Which brings us back to our dynamic start:

```jsx
<ul>{[1, 2, 3, 4].map(item => <li>{item}</li>}</ul>
```

Turns out this line that blew my mind was just a normal array and a very clever framework!

## Explore:

Explore arrays as Children in [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/dreamy-bell-mno6v?file=/src/App.js). It uses a small component to render the data type and count of the provided Children.
When it comes to Children, I find it an easier abandon JSX. Let me know if rolling without JSX reinforces your understanding of Children.
