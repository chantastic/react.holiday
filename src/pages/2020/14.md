Our component ended up in a weird place yesterday.

```jsx
let Greeting({ As, name }) {
  return <As>Hello {name}</As>
}
```

The capitalized `As` prop stands out. The capitalization is important to make the JSX transformer evaluate `As` as an expression. However, the capitalized attribute looks strong when used:

Fortunately, JavaScript has a [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) syntax that allows us to do two things at once:

- receive as, as a lowercase prop
- assign as's [value to a new `As` variable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Assigning_to_new_variable_names), capitalized for JSX evaluation

Using a colon — where we unpack props — the new assignment looks like this: `{ as: As }`

Here it is in context of our component declaration:

```jsx
function Greeting({ as: As, name }) {
  return <As>Hello {name}</As>;
}
```

## Take it home

When we assign object properties to new variable names, we can name them whatever we want. [Open this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/as-prop-step-2-ks36s?file=/src/App.js) and toy with the re-assignment syntax. Try Component, Tag, or anything else you like. This is a local variable. So there’s no “wrong” way to do it.
While you’re there, what happens if we don’t supply an as prop? Where can we provide a sensible default?
