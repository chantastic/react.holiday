If you click any of the buttons in our app _really fast_, you'll see this error.

![Warning: Can only update a mounted or mounting component. This usually means you called setState, replaceState, or forceUpdate on an unmounted component. This is a no-op.](/unmounted-component-warning.png)

We call `setState` inside the asynchronous `fetch`.
All works if our component is around to get updated but, when we click faster than the request can resolve, the component that requested it isn't around to be updated.

Our app has put another component there.

## Clean up your shit, Todd!

When we see this error, it means we did setup that we need to clean up. 
We do cleanup in the [componentWillUnmount](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentwillunmount) lifecycle method.

In `FetchPokemon` component needs to `cancel` the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) returned by [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

## Maybe next year...

I've updated the code below but cancellable `fetch` is a whole thing and I've got eggnog to drink.

As always‚Äîthe, the [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/) work for you all year long and there's a [great post on just this topic](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/12/16/ismounted-antipattern.html).

Happy holidays and have a Merry Christmas!
