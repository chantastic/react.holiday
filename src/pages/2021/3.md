This changes everything‚Ä¶ literally.

The way we render React apps to the DOM has remained the same since React's debut in 2013.\*

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<App />, DOMNode);
```

But that changes in React 18.

Remember what I said about gradual adoption? It allows us to render apps as if they are in React 17. The _new root API_ is how we opt into React 18 features and performance improvements.

Using ReactDOM.render (now _legacy root API_), our app renders in a React 17 compatibility mode. Using the _new root API_, opts we unlock React 18's new features and performance optimizations.

So what does it look like?

```jsx
ReactDOM.createRoot(DOMNode).render(<App />);
```

The _new root API_ splits root creation and mounting into two discrete steps. And we'll talk about why after a quick review.

Tomorrow, you can expect a video covering everything we've learned as a step-by-step walkthrough.

\*_I lied just a little bit. render() used to be called thru React until the ReactDOM package was extraced in 0.14._
