We've heard that “Concurrent Mode” is coming for years. And while there were a number of attempts, this “mode” never panned out.

But the failure of “Concurrent Mode” wasn't a failure. Concurrency in React 18 is better than ever! Today I want to make sure you have the right mental model for the concurrent capabilities of React 18.

With the exception of the automatic batching changes we covered, APIs available in React 17 behave the same in React 18. Full stop. If they don’t that’s a bug.

Components that make use of new APIs like startTransition, useTransition, and useDeferredValue, will opt their component trees into concurrent rendering.

This is another product of React’s gradual adoption strategy. You can upgrade to React 18 without concern learning about concurrent rendering in React. You can learn — just in time — as you utilize the new suite of concurrent features.

This strategy gives me confidence that code from my React 16 and 17 apps hiding bugs I'm not equipped to find.

Tomorrow we’ll dive into these new concurrent features!

This lesson is just make

In React 18, there is no concurrent "mode", only concurrent rendering and features.

Last week we learned how a gradual adoption strategy can help us safely, and confidently, migrate an app from React 17 to React 18. At this point, our app should work better than it did before, with minimal change.

But gradual adoption extends to new concurrent features as well.

Instead of a concurrent mode, concurrency is possible in all React 18 apps.

React 18 adds a set of new features, sometimes called "concurrent features" or "concurrent APIs". These features rely on a new mechanism called "concurrent rendering" that weren't possible before it.

It's a subtle but important change.
Concurrency is no longer something that you opt into at the root of your application. It's an enrichment that happens as you use "Concurrent features and APIs" like startTransition.

Concurrent rendering is not a mode.
Concurrent rendering is React.

In React 18, Concurrent React is React. Concurrent features and APIs — like startTransition — expose controls for opting into concurrent rendering.
