<div class="measure">

**Compose** means "smoosh things together."

You can **smoosh** ü•õ and ‚òïÔ∏è.

You can **smoosh** a üçî with your üòã.

You **smoosh** things all day; it's not fancy.

## Copy HTML

HTML is **smooshable** by default.

```html
<h1>
  <em>Tilted Heading</em>
</h1>
```

<br />

The `h1` and `em` are **smooshed**.

But if we try and **smoosh** things with our `ClapCounter`, nothing happens.

```jsx
<ClapCounter>
  <h1>Clap This!</h1>
</ClapCounter>
```
<br />

Y U NO SMOOSH?

## Meet `children`

All react components get a special prop: `children`.

Up to this point, we've had no `children`.
But the stork delivered one when we nested `<h1>Clap This!</h1>` in `<ClapCounter />`.

## Smooshing

Now that we have `children`, we can `render` them.
Let's put them at the top.

```jsx
class ClapCounter extends React.Component {
  render () {
    <div>
      {this.props.children}

      ...
```
<br />

Congrats! You learned how to **smoosh**.

We'll do more advanced **smooshing** next week.

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and explore **smooshing**.
* What happens if you keep the `{this.props.children}` but remove the nested `<h1>`?
* Can you smoosh another custom component in `ClapCounter`? Make one and find out.
