<div class="measure">
This is a React advent thingy; the whole 24 days, 24 lessons deal.

### Why?

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I like holidays.
I like helping people.
I think most React education is pathologically complicated.

This is a condensed version of how I teach people React. It's the stuff I use every day IRL. None of the 🐴💩 you see pegging Hacker News.

### Prerequisite?

I expect you to know JavaScript pretty well.

I don't cover setting up a build or working with Node.

Examples use [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/) and transport well to a
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
environment.

### Who dis?

I'm [@chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic). I make some other React stuff
like [learnreact.com](https://learnreact.com) ,
[https://reactpatterns.com](https://reactpatterns.com) , and
[https://reactcheatsheet.com](https://reactcheatsheet.com).
