There's one thing that every framework — from Rails to 11ty — gets wrong: layouts.

As apps becomes more complex, layout files find one of two destinations:

1. 1 layout file — littered with conditional statements around metadata, tags, and body classes
2. 10s or 100s of layout files that all duplicate a mostly identical document structure

Nested layout's give us a way to avoid these painful destinations.

**layout.jsx** is the another special file name in Next's app directory. It interact with **page.jsx** wherever it's found. Next composes them together like so:

```jsx
import AboutLayout from "./app/about/layout";
import AboutPage from "./app/about/page";

export default function AboutRoute() {
  return (
    <AboutLayout>
      <AboutPage />
    </AboutLayout>
  );
}
```

While Next automatically composes **layout** and **page** components together, we still need to write layouts components in way that accept and place `children`.

Add a **layout** for your `/about` route that wraps our **page** in a `<main>` element.

```jsx
// app/about/layout.jsx
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return <main>{children}</main>;
}
```

This may seem ridiculously simple. But as we'll soon see, it adds incredible potontial!

Assignment:
In the new layout. Add a link back to the home page. Notice how these changes _only_ impact the route where the layout file is. What happens if you nest another page in the `/about` route?
