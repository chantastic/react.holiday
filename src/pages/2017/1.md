<div class="measure">

In `C`, programs have a `main()` function.
It's where programs starts.

React web apps are similar; They start with `ReactDOM.render()`.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(someReactComponent, someDOMNode)
```

### WTF is ReactDOM?

React is used on a bunch of platforms.
Web, mobile, desktop, VRâ€”it's all over the place.

Instead of stuffing all those smarts into one gigantic library,
Platform-specific bits are split into plactform-specific labraries.

On the web, that's `ReactDOM`.

We use `React` to create components and `ReactDOM` render them into the DOM.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello ðŸŽ„'),
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

## Tinker with it

Use the window below and play around with the `render()` function.
* Remove the import statements. What errors do you get?
* Change the component type to something other than `h1`.
* Put some values in that empty object. What happens? What errors do you get?
