> It's time to let old things die — Kylo Ren

React is changing.

The oldest React mantra I know is "separate smart and dumb components". Stateful/stateless, pure/impure, view/controller, presentation/container... this separation of concerns goes by many names.

In practice instructors (me included) say:  
"Use function components until you can't. Then use a class."  

That's terrible advice.

React 16.7 makes that advice irrelevant.  
Function components take center stage  
And there's almost nothing they can't do.

We'll explore those new features soon.
For today, take a moment to learn something you didn't know about a function component.  
Send me what you come up with!

## For those new to React:
I applaud your curiosity 👏👏👏    
Explore `props` and how to use them with JSX.  
These articles from React Holiday 2017 will help you.
* JSX 4 LYFE: https://react.holiday/2017/2/
* Components are functions: https://react.holiday/2017/3/
* Props are arguments: https://react.holiday/2017/4/

## For the React lifers:
You might have to dig deep to find something you don't know.  
But there's gold to be found.

It older playlist that uses the React 15.4 included `PropTypes`.
But I'm sure you know how to navigate around that 😘

There are also new APIs to explore: [createRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactcreateref) and [forwardRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactforwardref).
