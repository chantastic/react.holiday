[Yesterday](/2017/14/), you might have noticed this console warning pop up with our list.

![react-unique-key-warning](/key-warning.png)

## 👶 Give the `children` keys 🔑

Following the warning above is simple but it leads some questions.

Pass a unique `key` prop to each component in our `map()`.

```jsx
<li key={someUniqueKey}>{ability.ability.name}</li>
```

## Why is this needed?

#### 👯‍♀️👯‍♂️ Teamwork!

With arrays, React needs assistance.

To quickly and accurately identify changed, updated, or deleted items, React uses your provided `key` for diffing.

## ❄️ How unique is unique? ❄️

Keys need to be unique to that array.
`id`s work great, if you got 'em.

Unfortunately, our `abilities` array doesn't have `id`s.
We can use `ability.name` because we know each ability is only listed once per character.

```jsx
<li key={ability.ability.name}>
  {ability.ability.name}
</li>
```
<br />

_(Again, `id` is preferred, when available.)_

## 🙅‍♂️ There's no `i` in team 👯‍♂️👯‍♀️

Avoid using the `map(item, i)` index.
It will make updates unpredictable.

Disregard this warning (if you must) but know that this is a common place for tricky bugs to creep in.

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and explore `keys`.
