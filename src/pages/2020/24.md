In the typical request-response lifecycle of an HTML page, submitted forms just dissolves into the impermanence of the web. In our case — where forms are submitted without a redirect — we have to reset forms on submit. Otherwise data will stick around, confusing the user.

In addition to the reset input — from yesterday — form elements have an API for imperatively resetting forms: `formElement.reset()`.

We can call reset() on the target element of our `onSubmit` event handler: `event.target.reset()`;

Easy-peasy. We’ve now reset the form on submit!

## Take it home

We’ve reset this form, sure. But we’ve done it in a way that React has no control over — it’s all just DOM operations thru and thru.

If we want to reset the form in response to an event elsewhere in our app, we need to use a [React ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) — React’s tool for exposing direct access to the DOM. Open [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/imperative-reset-on-submit-xsqv0?file=/src/App.js) and change the reset functionality to use a ref instead of the event directly. You’ll find instructions in the comments.
