Removing JSX from components, a couple confusing patterns become clearer.

If you didn’t already hate JSX for it’s uses of className and htmlFor over class and html, you hopped on the hate-train with [render props](https://reactpatterns.com/#render-prop).

## WTF is a render prop?

The render prop pattern is the [delegation pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern), branded for React. It extends a component’s children to take a function — which it calls back with data.

In use, render props look like this:

`<WindowWidth>{width => <div>{width}<div>}</WindowWidth>`

That looks nothing like the HTML-like syntax I was promised! So let’s check it out without JSX:

`createElement(WindowWidth, null, width => <div>{width}</div>)`

With JS removed, this is clearly a box-standard callback.

## Where did all the render props go?

For the most part, render props have been replaced by [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). However, they live on in legacy codebases, the Context.Consumer API, and in listing components (which we’ll cover next).

## Take it home

[This CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/relaxed-dew-uq3fq?file=/src/App.js) uses a JSX render prop to fetch a Pokemon. Take a moment and remove the JSX. Which do you find more scrutable and why?
