Indecision is the best tool you have for **smooshing** components together.

**Master it.**

## Listen to Cinderella; leave a clue

> I'll just leave him a clue:\
> For example, a shoe.\
> And then see what he'll do.

[On the Steps of the Palace](https://genius.com/Anna-kendrick-on-the-steps-of-the-palace-annotated),
Cinderella isn't sure what to do. So she leaves a shoe as a clue and lets
the prince decide what to do.

Let's codify this masterful indecision.

```jsx
class AClue extends React.Component {
  render() { return this.props.render('a shoe') }
}

const ThePrince = () =>
  <AClue
    render={clue =>
      <CheckEveryoneInTheKingdom clue={clue} />
    }
  />
```

<br />

If Cinderella were a React developer, she'd prefer **render props**.

## A render prop

Simply, **a render prop** is indecision.
React calls `render()` on a component which delegates to `props.render`.  

The power is in the clues.

```js
render() { this.props.render("a clue") }
```

## A fairy-tail refactor of `IdPager`

Let's refactor `IdPager#render()` to not-decide like Cinderella.

Start where we render the component.
Give `render` as a propâ€”
a function that takes **a clue** and returns a component.

Here, the clue **clue** is `id` and the return is a `<Pokemon />`.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <IdPager render={id => <Pokemon id={id} />} />,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
<br />

Component-side, it's simple as calling `props.render` with `state.id`.

```jsx
<div>
  ...
  {this.props.render(this.state.id)}
</div>
```

## Why though?

Using a [component prop](/2017/18) was great first step.
It allowed us to uncouple the component specifics.
But there remained a `prop` coupling around `id`.

With **render props**, we control all aspects of render.

```jsx
<IdPager
  render={id =>
    <OtherComponent
      anotherWordForId={id}
      className="some-class-name"
    />
  }
/>
```
## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and explore render props.

Create a `Character` component that consumes the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).
Render a second `IdPager` that pages through Star Wars `Character`s.
