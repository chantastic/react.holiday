<div class="measure">

In `C`, programs have a `main()` function.
It's where programs starts.

React apps are similar; on the web they start with `ReactDOM.render()`.

```js
ReactDOM.render(someReactComponent, someDOMNode)
```

### WTF is ReactDOM?

React is used all overâ€”web, mobile, desktop, VR, appliances.
Lots of places.

Instead of stuffing all those smarts into one enormous library,
each platform has a partner library.

On the web, that's `ReactDOM`.

We use `React` to create components and `ReactDOM` to render them into the DOM.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello ðŸŽ„'),
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

## Tinker with it

Use the window below and play around with `render()`.
* Comment out the import statements. What errors do you get?
* Change the component type to something other than `h1`.
* Put some values in the empty object (second argument). What happens? What errors do you get?
