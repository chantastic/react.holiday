Gweneth got it right.
[Conscious Uncoupling](https://goop.com/work/relationships/conscious-uncoupling-2/) is a good (for components).

Let's explore a new [smooshing](/2017/12) technique that makes `PokemonPager` reusable.

## Insert component here

You can **insert** components into other components via props.

Because [components are functions](https://react.holiday/2017/3) and JavaScript functions transportable, we can pass components around.

```jsx
<SomeComponent component={OtherComponent} />
```

<br />

The above might be implemented something like this:

```jsx
const OtherComponent = () => <h2>üëã</h2>

const SomeComponent = props => <props.component />
```

<br />

_(Yes, JSX lets you do that)_

## Uncoupling `PokemonPager`

Our `PokemonPager` doesn't need to be Pokemon specific.
With a little work, it could render anything that takes an `id` prop.

Let's uncouple it by **inserting** `Pokemon` via a `component` prop.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <PokemonPager component={Pokemon} />,
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```
<br />

Now update the `PokemonPager` to render `this.props.component` where `<Pokemon />` is.

```jsx
<this.props.component id={this.state.id} />
```
<br />

Finally, rename `PokemonPager` to a `IdPager`, wherever you see it.

## Smooshing is magic

We're getting to the good stuff.
**Smooshing** is the magic of React üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is the first of three **smooshing** patterns we'll explore this week.

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and explore component insertion **smooshing**.
* Create a new component called `ShowId` and **insert** it into `IdPager` where `Pokemon` is now.
* Read the doc on defaultProps. Use your new `ShowId` component as the `defaultProps` for `omponent`.
