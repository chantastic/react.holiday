<div class="measure">

Components are just functions.

<span style="font-size: 3em">ðŸ¤¯</span>

### How do I write said component functions?
Easy.

Here's one that spits out our `Hello ðŸŽ„` wherever used.

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello ðŸŽ„</h1>;
}
```

### How do I use said component functions?

JSX has you covered.
Just use the function name like an HTML tag.

```jsx
<Greeting />
<Greeting></Greeting>
```

### That's it?

Pretty much, but here's something to remember - Capitalize your Custom Components.
If you don't, JSX transformers assume you meant a native DOM element.

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below to play with components.

* Write and use a component of your own creation.
* Mix custom components and native components. Any issues?
