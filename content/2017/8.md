Managing state is hard.

I'll take four days to cover the React APIs for setting state.  
So don't read today's lesson without coming back for [set state dynamically](/2017/9) and [setState is a food truck](/2017/10).

## setState is GrrrrREAT!
Meet [setState()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate).

```js
this.setState({ someProp: newState })
```
<br />

This is a [special power](/2017/5) our components get by extending `React.Component`.  
When called, `setState` updates the local `state` object and re-renders the component.

## Set state statically
Continue [yesterday's](/2017/7) example and replace the `alert` with a proper state change.

```js
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() =>
    this.setState({ clapCount: 1 })
  }
>
  {this.state.clapCount}
  {' '}👏
</button>
```

## Limitations

Above, we call `setState()` with a new state object.

There are [two ways to use setState](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate). 
This one is easy to understand but quickly limiting.
We set `clapCount` with a static value but how do we use a dynamic value?
How do we keep our counter counting, transitioning current state to the next state?

Tomorrow we'll learn how to transition state.

## Tinker with it

Use the workspace below and set some state.
* Change value you set `clapCount` to. Get crazy; try a string.
* Create another component that counts something else. 👍s, 🙌s, anything!
* Keep the counter counting. Try your hand at making state changes dynamic.
